<h1>The Best Movie According to Meutia</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies All The Time!</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Flipped [2010]</h3>
<p>A coming of age movie with a setting in the 80s. The story of July Baker and Bryce Loski who live
     next door to each other. We can see the ordinary love story that is intertwined between the two main
     characters, reminiscent of the feeling when we first fell in love. This is one of the interesting
     things that allows me to watch Flipped over and over again, even though I already know the storyline
     and ending. The simplicity in this movie feels far more related to what we face in everyday life. More
     than that, another interesting thing is that this film is two points of view from each character with
     a different gender. We can see how a teenage girl sees things from her point of view--which is
     represented by July Baker. Likewise for Bryce Loski.</p>

<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty [2013]</h3>
<p>Tells the story of Walter Mitty, an ordinary employee at Life magazine, who likes to daydream. He often imagines
    great scenarios that will happen to him, without taking real action to actually make it happen in his
    life. Until in the end he was faced with a challenge that made him feel a great adventure that
    required him to get out of his own comfort zone. What a great movie! I really liked the message at the
    end of this movie.</p>

<h3>Little Forest</h3>
<p>Again a film that offers simplicity. This can be a refreshing choice when we are too bored to see 
    story plots that are too complicated. This film was originally adapted from a Japanese comic with the
    same title, and then made in two parts according to the changing seasons. It seems that the popularity
    of this film is unbelievable, so Korea is also trying to adapt it into its version. Both versions
    bring out the best. The audience will be spoiled by the natural beauty of Japan and Korea. Also, made
    hungry with a variety of home-cooked dishes that are the center of attention in this film. Making all
    of us, who may be grown up and living far from home, feel comfortable and like we are at home. Very
    homely.</p>
